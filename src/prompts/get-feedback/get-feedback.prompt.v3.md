Question: "Can you explain what a binary search tree (BST) is and how it works?"
User Response: "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node. This property makes the BST efficient for search operations."
